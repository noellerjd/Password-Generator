# Password-Generator
by Justin Noeller

The hope of this project was to get a properly working password generator, adding in Uppercase, Numbers, and Special charaters upon request.

I built this project to train upon variables, strings, if statements, and alerts in order to become more familiar with them.

This project allows one to create a truly random password that they can also control the characters of to some degree

I learned not to be so intimidated by JavaScript mainly, but also learned a ton as to how these variables interact with each other, and when they don't. I also learned how to control the variables to add or subtract from a string. I learned a lot to be honest but these were some of the main things.

My project may not stand out but I do think the way I solved this may be interesting to someone else because I solved this with as much of my own understanding as I possibly could. I am sure there are more efficient ways to code this but I do like my way!
